# Clean-And-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys
**Reasons for resignation: Investigating the reasons for employee departure at Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and Technical and Further Education (TAFE)
**
**This project aims to understand the reasons for employee resignation at DETE and TAFE. We aim to answer the following questions:
**
1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
